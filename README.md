# Emotional Market


## Overview and Origin

* In this presentation we will discuss the emotional response of twitter to Covid- 19 and how that impacted the SP&500. 
* The origination of this project came up when our team wanted to understand the trends of how we react and how that truly makes a difference on the market. 
* Through the files in the repo you will find monthly data of covid information that we further analyze in Covid-Data-Analysis while also putting in the SP&500.
* After analyzing this information we answered the following questions coming to the conclusion that are hypothesis was incorrect- there is no correlation between SP&500 and Covid-19.


## Data Analysis:
* Creating the visuals to see the correlation between the different datasets 
* Create a heatmap and plot table 
* Find ways to clean data and utilize just the numeric values

* illustrated with a sunburst - which helps with seeing how concentrated the tweets were in worry and once we click into the visual we can see each the trends by the months and notice that categories also vary by month.
