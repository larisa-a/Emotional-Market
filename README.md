# Emotional Market


## Overview and Origin

* In this presentation we will discuss the emotional response of twitter to Covid- 19 and how that impacted the SP&500. 
* The origination of this project came up when our team wanted to understand the trends of how we react and how that truly makes a difference on the market. 
* Through the files in the repo you will find monthly data of covid information that we further analyze in Covid-Data-Analysis while also putting in the SP&500.
* After analyzing this information we answered the following questions coming to the conclusion that are hypothesis was incorrect- there is no correlation between SP&500 and Covid-19.


## Data Analysis:
* Creating the visuals to see the correlation between the different datasets 
* Create a heatmap and plot table 
* Find ways to clean data and utilize just the numeric values
